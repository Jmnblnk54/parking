            <h3>Part I – Traveler Reservation Services</h3>
            <p>
              <h3> Space Reservation</h3> Yugo Park provides the Reservation
              Services to Users for the sole purposes of providing Users
              information on the location and apparent availability of parking
              and assisting them in securing parking at participating
              third-party parking locations, including but not limited to
              private driveways, private garages, and private lots. In response
              to a User’s online request for a reservation through the Yugo Park
              Website or a Yugo Park Application, User communicates directly
              with the applicable individual holding/operating said space (the
              Host of the Listing) regarding such reservation request.
            </p>
            <p>
              The availability of reservations is determined at the time of a
              User’s query, and Yugo Park makes no representation or warranty
              (i) regarding the accuracy of any data (including, but not limited
              to, reservation availability data) received from any Host. Each
              Host is an independent third party and is not under the control of
              Yugo Park. Yugo Park is not a guarantor, agent, or otherwise
              affiliated with any Host. You acknowledge that each Host may have
              its own policies, terms, and conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once a reservation request is made by a User through the Yugo
              Park’s Website or any Yugo Park Application, the Host with such
              space will provide confirmation of the Reservation to such User
              either by pre-authorizing the Services to auto accept all
              reservation requests within specified hours and specified days, or
              by manual approval at the time of request. By using the
              Reservation Services, you agree to receive reservation
              confirmations by Yugo Park messaging after requesting Reservation
              through the Reservation Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may terminate your Reservation at any time by emailing Yugo
              Park at manage@YugoPark.com. In furtherance of (and not in any
              limitation of) the above, you hereby acknowledge and agree that
              notwithstanding the assistance that the Reservation Services
              provide to you in locating and reserving parking, the ultimate
              decision to utilize the parking information provided by the
              Reservation Services and to park at any location remains yours and
              yours alone, and you hereby agree to assume any risk inherent in
              utilizing the Reservation Services and/or deciding to actually
              park at any location
            </p>
            <p>
              For the avoidance of doubt, Yugo Park does not in any way provide
              parking services or any kind or operate any parking locations.
              FURTHER, YUGO PARK ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR (1)
              THE SAFETY OF ANY PERSON, PROPERTY, OR VEHICLE PARKED AT ANY
              LOCATION OR (2) THE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF PARKING AT ANY
              LOCATION. USE OF, OR A RESERVATION THROUGH, ANY YUGO PARK
              APPLICATION WILL IN NO WAY BE CONSIDERED A WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, OR
              OTHER REPRESENTATION THAT A SPECIFIC PARKING SPACE IS AVAILABLE AT
              ANY LOCATION AT ANY GIVEN TIME. YUGO PARK DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL
              LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES, DELAYS, OR OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY
              ARISE IF A PARKING SPACE IS UNAVAILABLE, OR IF A YUGO PARK
              APPLICATION OTHERWISE ERRS OR MALFUNCTIONS.

                {" "}
                Calculation of Parking Rates; Payment Authorization; Taxes
              </h3>{" "}
              You acknowledge that Yugo Park does not determine parking rates
              with Hosts to facilitate the booking of Reservations. The parking
              rate displayed on the Yugo Park Website or Yugo Park Application
              is determined solely by the Host and Yugo Park’s fees that are in
              direct relation to the price set by the Host. You agree to pay in
              full the price displayed on the Services for the total reservation
              price, which includes the parking rate plus, where applicable,
              service fees, and taxes at the time of your reservation request.
              All Reservations and other transactions consummated through the
              Yugo Park Website or a Yugo Park Application will be turned over
              to the relevant Host, and thereafter, a User may be required to
              enter into a separate agreement with that relevant Host. You
              acknowledge and confirm that you are authorized and permitted to
              use any credit card that you register on the Yugo Park Website or
              a Yugo Park Application. When you fund a transaction, you agree
              that Yugo Park is not in any way responsible or liable for the
              transaction. You acknowledge that Yugo Park does not collect taxes
              for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The Hosts are
              solely responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the
              applicable taxing jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3> Prices</h3> The price of a parking reservation will be
              determined by the Host with the legal right to reserve said
              private location. Prices at each private location may change from
              time to time and at any time, but any such changes will not affect
              bookings already accepted by a Yugo Park Application. Despite Yugo
              Park’s best efforts, some of the parking listed on the Services
              may be incorrectly priced. Yugo Park is under no obligation to
              fulfill a Reservation, even after you have been sent confirmation
              of your Reservation. We do not guarantee that pricing for
              Reservations will be the best available at the time of reservation
              or reservation request.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3> Traveler Service Fees</h3> By utilizing the platform’s
              Services you agree to pay a service fee in addition to the listed
              spot cost. Yugo Park may change its fees or fee structure at any
              time without notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3> Usage Guidelines</h3> User agrees to use the Reservation
              Services only to book Reservations for User’s own use. Resale or
              attempted resale of Reservations is ground for, among other
              things, cancellation of your Reservations and termination of your
              access to the Services. Yugo Park expressly reserves all its
              rights and remedies under applicable state and federal laws. Yugo
              Park reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse
              service, terminate User accounts, remove or edit content, or
              cancel Reservations. Users also agree not to contact or attempt to
              contact Hosts by means other than the Services with intent to
              conduct a rental transaction for a property listed with the
              Services. You also agree not to use the Services to solicit or
              offer other users goods or services of any kind beyond reserving
              and renting parking spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Cancellations and Violations</h3>
              By requesting a Reservation, you are agreeing to pay the rate
              published at that time for the requested period. If you later
              choose to cancel the Reservation, you agree to be subject to the
              Yugo Park Cancellation Policy which is subject to change without
              notice. You may also receive penalties for failure to remove your
              vehicle from a Host’s property by the end of the reservation
              period. Penalties for cancellation or failure to vacate a property
              at the agreed upon time may include but are not limited to, cash
              fines to be paid immediately, account suspensions, necessary
              towing fees, and negative reviews posted publicly on the Services
              in association with your account, which will inform and warn other
              Users of your cancellation or failure to vacate at the agreed upon
              time. By registering your payment information with the Services,
              you agree to allow Yugo Park to automatically charge in accordance
              with these policies. The fees and fines charged may vary. The Yugo
              Park Cancellation Policy is expressly incorporated herein by
              reference.

            <p>
              <h3> Damage to Person or Property</h3> By consenting to these
              Terms & Conditions you acknowledge that when you enter into a
              rental agreement with a Host you are choosing to enter the
              property offered by the Host for parking at your own discretion.
              By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that Yugo Park is not
              the owner or operator of any property available for rent via the
              Services and is not responsible for any damage or loss to property
              or person that may occur while you are on the Host’s property or
              engaged in a Reservation with the Host. All parking transactions
              are entered into at your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee
              in any way the security of your vehicle or its contents. It is
              your responsibility to ensure that your vehicle is properly
              secured. If your vehicle is damaged while on a Host’s property,
              you agree to first attempt to resolve the matter with the Host. If
              the matter cannot be resolved through direct contact with the
              Host, you may contact Yugo Park customer service to record your
              case so that we can assess the situation and offer recourse where
              Yugo Park, in its sole discretion, deems such necessary. If your
              vehicle is stolen, contact the police and your insurance provider
              immediately. Yugo Park does not provide any insurance coverage to
              a User at any time. Certain Hosts may provide services in addition
              to parking, including but not limited to valet. These services may
              require you as a Guest to relinquish your keys to the Host. By
              accepting these terms and conditions, you acknowledge that any
              personal or property damage is the sole responsibility of the
              Host. Yugo Park makes no representation and warrants the liability
              of these services. If a user utilizes these services and releases
              their keys, they do so at their own risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Payment Escrow, Distribution, and Chargebacks</h3> All funds
              paid by you for the use of a Host’s property will be held in an
              escrow account (Yugo Wallet) by our merchant partner, Stripe

              By creating a Listing in the Services and becoming a Host, you
              appoint Yugo Park as your agent for the purposes of connecting
              your offered space with Travelers in need of parking services and
              forming binding agreements between you and Travelers using the
              Services. You also appoint as your agent for the collection and

              <h3>Legal Right to Rent Property</h3>
              Yugo Park provides tools and features that enable Hosts to list
              and rent their property for parking use. By using the Services to
              list an available parking space for rent, you are attesting that
              you are the legal owner/operator of the property being offered or
              have obtained the right to rent out the property. It is your
              responsibility to be aware of and abide by all local laws, codes,
              or HOA and neighborhood policies. Yugo Park is no way responsible
              for any repercussions stemming from your failure to make yourself
              aware of and abide by your local laws and regulations.

            <p>
              <h3>Honoring reservations, Cancellations & Penalties</h3>
              All Hosts will have the opportunity to approve or decline
              reservation requests from Users (whether manually at the time of
              request or by pre-authorizing Yugo Park to automatically approve
              all requests for the period of the time that the listing is
              available). Once you have approved a reservation request, you must
              honor the request. If you choose to cancel an approved request you
              agree to be subject to the Yugo Park Cancellation Policy which is
              subject to change at Yugo Park’s sole discretion. You also agree
              that Yugo Park may assess penalties for failure to deliver a
              reserved parking space to another User. Penalties may include but
              are not limited to, cash fines to be paid immediately or taken
              from your future earnings until paid in full, account suspensions
              and negative reviews posted publicly on the Services in
              association with your account, which will inform and warn other
              Users of your cancellation or failure to deliver a reserved
              parking space. By registering your payment information with the
              Services, you agree to allow Yugo Park to automatically charge you
              in accordance with these policies. The fees and fines charged may
              vary.

              portion of the gross parking cost to Yugo Park as a service fee
              for all completed transactions. Yugo Park may change its fees or
              fee structure at any time without notice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Payment Escrow, Distribution, and Chargebacks</h3>
              All funds paid by Travelers for the use of your property will be
              held in an escrow account (Yugo Wallet) by our merchant partner,
              Stripe Payments. We will allow the option for instant payouts for
              a small fee or the standard option of payments released on the
              Monday of every week, for no fee. We may also elect to garnish or
              withhold future parking distributions owed you for reasons that
              may include but are not limited to, reimbursement of Traveler
              chargebacks, when the chargeback was directly correlated to a
              Reservation carried out on your Listing, or penalty fees that we
              may charge for violating this set of Terms & Conditions. Yugo Park
              uses Stripe for payment processing services. By using the Stripe
              payment processing services you agree to the Stripe Payment

              property that you have listed with the Services by means other

              reservation with you. All parking transactions are entered into at
              your own risk. We cannot and do not guarantee in any way the
              security or safety of your property. It is your responsibility to

              damaged by another Yugo Park user, you agree to first attempt to
              resolve the matter with the user. If the matter cannot be resolved
              through direct contact with the user, you may contact Yugo Park
              Customer service to record your case so that we can assess the
              situation and offer recourse where possible and where we deem

              required insurance coverage necessary to rent out your property

              accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). In
              response to a valid notice (as described below) we will remove any
              allegedly infringing content from the Services and will take
              reasonable steps to contact the provider of the removed content so
              that a counter-notification may be filed. Upon receipt of a valid
              counter-notification, we will evaluate the counter notification
              and determine whether to restore the content in question, unless
              we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal
              action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the
              alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity. If you
              believe any of the Services violate your copyright, notify our
              copyright agent in writing.

              relationship exists between you and any of the Yugo Park Parties
              as a result of agreeing to these Terms & Conditions or use of the
              Services. Further, no joint venture, partnership, or employment
              relationship exists between any of the Yugo Park Parties and any
              Host. Our performance of this Terms & Conditions is subject to
              existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this
              Terms & Conditions limits our right to comply with law enforcement
              or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating
              to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered
              by us with respect to such use. A printed version of this Terms &
              Conditions and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
              admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
              relating to this Terms & Conditions to the same extent and subject

              originally generated and maintained in printed form. Fictitious
              names of companies, products, people, characters, and/or data
              mentioned within the Services are not intended to represent any

            <p>
              <h3>Severability</h3>
              If any part of this Terms & Conditions is determined to be invalid
              or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not
              limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
              forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
              deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
              closely matches the intent of the original provision and Agreement
              shall continue in effect
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Assignment</h3>
              These Terms & Conditions, and the rights granted and obligations
              undertaken hereunder, may not be transferred, assigned or

            <p>
              <h3>Waiver</h3>

              by any party in the enforcement of any right hereunder, shall
              neither be construed as a continuing waiver nor create an
              expectation of non-enforcement of that or any other provision or
              right.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h3>Arbitration and Venue</h3>
              Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or
              causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this
              clause) between you and the Yugo Park Parties or their successors
              or assigns shall exclusively be settled through binding and
              confidential arbitration in Manchester, New Hampshire.
              .Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and
              not any state arbitration law. The arbitration shall be conducted
              before one commercial arbitrator, certified by the American
              Arbitration Association (“AAA”), with substantial experience in
              resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms
              & Conditions, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in
              writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s{" "}
              <a href="">Commercial Arbitration Rules</a> and Procedures.
            </p>
            <p>
              You and Yugo Park must abide by the following rules: (a) ANY
              CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR YUGO PARK MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S
              INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
              PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR
              MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT
              OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS
              PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) the
              arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized
              at law; (d) the arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you
              nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any
              arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of
              enforcement of the arbitration award; (e) the arbitrator may award
              any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by
              applicable law; and (f) each side pays its own attorneys’ fees and
              expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the
              prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses, and,
              in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined
              by the applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Yugo Park may bring
              an individual action in small claims court. Further, claims of
              defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and
              infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent,
              copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this
              arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in
              the state or federal courts located in Manchester, New Hampshire.
              Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either
              party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or
              federal courts located in Manchester, New Hampshire in order to
              maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to
              submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
              located within Manchester, New Hampshire for such purpose. A
              request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the
              right to arbitrate.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) in this Section
              (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any
              part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
              unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules
              and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision
              shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with
              its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
              part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or
              (b) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the
              entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and
              neither you nor Yugo Park shall be entitled to arbitration. If for
              any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration,
              the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court
              located in Manchester, New Hampshire. For more information on AAA,
              the Rules and Procedures, or the process for filing an arbitration
              claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website
