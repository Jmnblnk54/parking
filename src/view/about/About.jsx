                  You Can't Ignore
                </h2>
                Did you know the challenges of finding a parking spot are more
                significant than you might think? The following eye-opening
                statistics reveal how stressful and time-consuming parking can

                <h3> Circling the Block:</h3> Research indicates that 30% of
                urban traffic is caused by drivers searching for parking spots.
                This wastes time and contributes to increased air pollution and
                stress levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h3> Time Drain:</h3> American drivers spend 17 hours per year
                searching for parking, costing them $345 per driver in wasted
                time, fuel, and emissions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h3> Beach Parking Blues:</h3> During peak beach season, parking
                lots and street parking options often reach capacity early,
                forcing visitors to park far away from the beach or miss out on
                a day of fun in the sunâ€¦entirely.
              </p>
              <p>

                stadiums found that over 40% of fans experienced difficulty
                finding parking, with some even missing the beginning of the
                game due to parking challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
