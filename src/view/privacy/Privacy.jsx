          <p>
            We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm

            collect when you use our website
            <a href="http://www.yugopark.com"> http://www.yugopark.com</a>{" "}
            (collectively the “Service” or “Site”). By accessing or using the

            your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <ol type="a">
            <li>Personal Information</li>
            <p>
              "Personal Information" is information that identifies, relates to,
              describes, or can be reasonably linked to, directly or indirectly,
              a particular individual or household. We may collect Personal
              Information from you on or through the Services in a variety of
              ways, including when you register on the Websites, purchase a
              Service, participate in online surveys, sign-up for a newsletter
              or subscription. We also may, from time to time, receive Personal
              Information about you from third-party sources to improve the
              Services, and for the various purposes outlined in this Privacy
              Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have grouped together the following categories of Personal
              Information to explain how we use this type of information. These
              terms are used throughout this Privacy Policy: Personal

            <li>Device Identifiable Information</li>
            <p>
              We may collect information that may not reasonably identify you or
              a household personally, but is linked to your computer or device
              ("Device Identifiable Information"). We collect Device
              Identifiable Information from you in the normal course of
              providing the Services. When you visit our Websites to browse or
              read information, we automatically collect information about your
              computer that your browser sends, such as your IP address, browser
              type and language, access times, pages visited, and referring
              website addresses. We may use Device Identifiable Information to
              analyze trends, help administer the Services, track the online
              movement of users, to learn about and determine how much time
              visitors spend on each page of the Websites, how visitors navigate
              throughout the Websites or use other Services, and to gather broad
              demographic information for aggregate use. We may also collect
              Device Identifiable Information through "cookies" or "web beacons"
              as explained below.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we may collect information about your mobile device
              such as the type and model, operating system (e.g. iOS or
              Android), carrier name, mobile browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari),
              applications using our Websites, and identifiers assigned to your
              device, such as its iOS Identifier for Advertising ("IDFA"),
              Android Advertising ID ("AAID"), or unique device identifier (a
              number uniquely given to your device by your device manufacturer),
              sometimes referred to as a mobile carrier ID.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also collect your location information, such as your zip
              code or the approximate geographic area provided by your Internet
              service provider ("ISP") or location positioning information
              provided by the location services and GPS features of your mobile
              device when location services have been enabled.

              <h3>How We Collect Your Information</h3>
              <li>Cookies and Web Beacons</li>
              <p>
                To help us serve you better, we may collect Device Identifiable
                Information from you through technologies such as "cookies" and
                "web beacons" (which are also called clear GIFs, pixel tags, or
                pixels) or by tracking internet protocol ("IP") addresses.
                "Cookies" are small data files that are stored by your web
                browser when you interact with a website. When you visit a
                webpage, the cookie sends back Device Identifiable Information.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Web beacons" are small graphic images (usually invisible) that
                can be embedded in content and ads on a webpage that track usage
                of the Websites and effectiveness of communication. These web
                beacons can then be used to recognize our cookies and to monitor
                certain user interactions with a website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies operate in the background and you can turn them off by
                adjusting your Web browser settings, but doing so may make it
                difficult to use some of the features on the Websites or the
                features may not be available to you. We may use cookies to make
                your Website experience easier by, for example, remembering your
                preferences, keeping track of your login name, password, etc. We
                may also use cookies and other activity tracking tools on the
                Websites and through other Services to collect your engagement
                metrics, including your Personal Identifiers and Device
                Identifiable Information, related to your activity on the
                Websites and Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows
                you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and
                services that you do not want them to track your online
                activities. The Websites and Services do not currently support
                Do Not Track requests.
              </p>
              <li>Other Direct Interactions with You</li>
              <p>
                You give us your information in your direct interactions with
                us. We collect information you provide to us when you sign up
                for accounts on our Websites and other Services; request
                services, or information from us; respond to surveys;
                participate in sweepstakes or contests; or otherwise interact
                with us. This information includes Personal Identifiers, Contact
                Information, Biographical Information, Financial Information,
                and Device Identifiable Information, which you give us from time
                to time.
              </p>
              <li>Social Media</li>
              <p>
                When using the Services or when using certain third party social
                networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) (each a "Social
                Network"), you may have the option to connect your Service
                information and activity with your Social Network information
                and activity. If you authorize such a connection, you permit us
                to share or publish information about your Service activity with
                that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your
                Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you
                consent to the connection. Information we may share with a
                Social Network may include technical information about your
                Service activity, your Service comments. Information we may
                access about you, with your consent, from a Social Network may
                include, but is not limited to, your basic Social Network
                information, your location data, your list of contacts, friends
                or followers and certain information about your activities on
                the Social Network. If you permit a connection between a Social
                Network and a Service, we (and that Social Network) may be able
                to identify you and to associate information received pursuant
                to the connection with information we already have about you.
                For more information, please review the privacy disclosures and
                terms of your Social Network account, which govern how that
                account information is collected and shared with us.
